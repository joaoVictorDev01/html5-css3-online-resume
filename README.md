This project is a résumé (not all personal information is real and was used for demonstration purposes) built using HTML and CSS to practice fundamental skills with these technologies. During its development, I faced some challenges, especially related to the box model and box-sizing. However, in the end, everything worked as expected.

This project does not include JavaScript, but I plan to implement it in future projects.

Working on this résumé helped me understand my difficulties and showed me that, even when facing challenges, it is important to keep going. This is only the beginning, and I plan to build many more projects.
